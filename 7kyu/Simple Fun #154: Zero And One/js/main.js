/*
DESCRIPTION:

You have a string that consists of zeroes and ones. Now choose any two 
adjacent positions in the string: if one of them is 0, and the other 
one is 1, remove these two digits from the string.

Return the length of the resulting (smallest) string that you can get
after applying this operation multiple times?

Note: after each operation, the remaining digits are separated by 
spaces and thus not adjacent anymore - see the examples below.

Example:
