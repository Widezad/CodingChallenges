DESCRIPTION:

The medians of a triangle are the segments that unit the vertices 
with the midpoint of their opposite sides. The three medians of a 
triangle intersect at the same point, called the barycenter or the 
centroid. Given a triangle, defined by the cartesian coordinates of 
its vertices we need to localize its barycenter or centroid.

The function bar_triang() or barTriang or bar-triang, receives the 
coordinates of the three vertices A, B and C  as three different arguments and outputs the coordinates of the barycenter O in an array [xO, yO]
