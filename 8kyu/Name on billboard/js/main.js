/*
You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will
cost you. Each letter has a default price of £30, but that can 
be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1.

You can not use multiplier "*" operator.

If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600.
20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a letter).

function billboard(name, price = 30){
    return name.split('').reduce(total => total + price, 0)
}
//test cases
console.log(billboard('wideza denis')) //360
