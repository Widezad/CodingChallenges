Description:

Task

Your friend advised you to see a new performance in the most 
popular theater in the city. He knows a lot about art and his 
advice is usually good, but not this time: the performance 
turned out to be awfully dull. It's so bad you want to sneak 
out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is 
located right behind your row to the left. All you need to do 
is climb over your seat and make your way to the exit.
