/*
Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged 
because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop 
goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move 
on to tricks".
If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until 
you get it".

//hoop count funtion
function hoopCount (n) {
       
}
console.log(hoopCount(3)) //"Keep at it until you get it"
console.log(hoopCount(3)) //"Great, now move on to tricks"
